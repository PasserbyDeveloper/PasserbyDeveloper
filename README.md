Hi, I am a tech guy, computer engineer, and programming enthusiast.

I am currently mastering a few novel tech stacks like Nodejs, React/Vue, MongoDB and ElasticSearch, and I intend in create some great projects while I'm at it.

By the way I was a tab-versus-space programmer until the great tabulation war ended and deemed us the losers of it (thanks google). I have been given the option to be exiled or to switch to the space-versus-tabs and here I am, typing 4 spaces at a time, like an animal.
